For this tutoriaI had my first experience working with the static site generators Jekyll and Middleman when I created this blog. They're super cool. All I need is my console, my text editor a Github account and I'm ready to roll. What I like about being able to host my site on Github is that my latest source code is accesible from other machines and I don't have to go through the extra step of FTPing my files once they're ready.

#### Step 1: Sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_new"} account if you don't already have one.
You can sign up and create repositories for free if you don't mind them being public. There's a monthly fee for private repositories.

#### Step 2: Create a new repository on your machine:


{% highlight ruby %}
{% endhighlight %}
